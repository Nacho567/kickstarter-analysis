# Kickstarting with Excel

## **Overview of Project**

### **Purpose**

To discover how different Kickstarter plays fared based on their launch dates and funding goals.

## **Analysis and Challenges**

I performed my analysis by creating two sheets from the main Kickstarter data. The first was 'Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date', sorted by months. The other was 'Play Outcomes Based on Goals' and those were 12 levels of goal amounts ranging from $0-50,000+. Both sheets were then put into a line graph.

### **Challenges and Difficulties Encountered**

There were no major difficulties encountered, but in looking at outcomes based on goals, it required a second look to see that no play was canceled, only successful or failed.

## **Results**

- As you can see, May and June have the most successful Theater projects, which leads into a decline until September. December has the least successful projects.

- Looking at successful projects based on goals, the most successful Plays are $5000 or less, or $35000-50000. Only two Plays over $45000 were successful, so overall smaller and/or cheaper plays were more successful.

- This data only tells us if plays and theater projects were successful based on two data points, but that's not the only factor that can make it successful.

- Another great graph that could be used is what kind of plays were most successful. This isn't on the Kickstarter data, but knowing if a sci-fi play was the key to success, or a good old Shakespeare one could determine much. Or maybe audiences don't want to see a play about warm beaches in the middle of December.
